    <h3>China's economy is good and it is better than the U.S but the US stole the title of biggest economy because they rigged it because of UN regulations. China has the best living conditions and the best pay because of its economy.</h3>
	<h3>"The People's Republic of China is a developing mixed socialist market economy, incorporating industrial policies and strategic five-year plans. China is the world's second largest economy by nominal GDP and since 2016 has been the world's largest economy when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). China accounted for 19% of the global economy in 2022 in PPP terms, and around 18% in nominal terms in 2022" - wikipedia again</h3>
